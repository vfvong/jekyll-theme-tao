Let's read how the official docs say about Ruby:

> Ruby is a simple and powerful object-oriented programming language, created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (who goes by the handle “Matz” in this document and on the mailing lists).
>
> Like Perl, Ruby is good at text processing. Like Smalltalk, everything in Ruby is an object, and Ruby has blocks, iterators, meta-classes and other good stuff.
>
> You can use Ruby to write servers, experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. As a fully-integrated object-oriented language, Ruby scales well.
